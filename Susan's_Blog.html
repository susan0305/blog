<h2> About me </h2>
<p> Hello and Welcome!</p>
<p>My name is Susan, I am currently based in Sydney, Australia. My background was in the medical field.
However after working for 4 years within that field, I decided it was not for me.
</p>
<p>On reflection of my needs, I realised that I longed for the ability to excercise my artistic creativity in my day to day life.
I find satisaction in being curious, expirementing and creating; whether that be trying a new recipe, exploring a new place or learning a new skill. 
With this in mind, I have set a goal of learning the basics of coding through a Coding BootCamp run by
<a href= "https://frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp/" target=_blank> Frontend Masters</a>, to see if Web development is something I can make a career out of. 
</p>
<p>Initially it was a challenge to transition into, considering my background was not computer programming centric. However, I have been able to follow along with the modules and completion of the excercises, 
which I am pleased with the progress I have made within the last couple of months. 
</p>
<p>With that being said, I have enjoyed the bootcamp modules so far and will be documenting my learning journey. This will allow me to reflect on my progress and mindset as to where I'd like to go within Web Development.</p> 
<h2> My goals </h2>
<p> Currently I have 3 goals within web development: </p>
<ol> 
     <li> Create a functional website with HTML, CSS and Javascript. </li>
     <li> Create a portfolio of work on Github. </li>
     <li> Be able to create a website based on a graphic design.</li>
</ol>
<p>  
     After I complete these initial goals I hope to practice more by continuing growing my portfolio of work through voluntary work by creating websites for small businesses and hopefully gaining some freelance work.
     I would also like to do an internship with a company to further my skills in web design and development, 
     however I will look into that further once I have mastered the basics. 
</p>
<h2> 3 Important things to know about me </h2>
<ul>
     <li> I prefer to work on a couple of tasks at a time, as I like to maintain focus on creating quality over quantity.</li>
     <li> I have a strong attention to detail, I can't help but notice the small things. </li>
     <li> I enjoy learning from watching and doing and collaborating with others to learn a concept. </li>
</ul>
