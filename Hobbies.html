    <h1> Things I like to do </h1>

<p>One of my hobbies I thoroughly enjoy would be hiking and camping which go hand in hand.</p>
<p> Although it requires some planning, hiking to experience the natural landscape is something that makes me feel alive, and is a great way to unwind.
    Whenever my partner and I go on a hike I feel so refreshed and invigorated when we return to the big city. It is a truly awesome feeling that I adore.
    One of the best parts about camping is seeing the stars all speckled in the night sky twinkling so bright through the milky way. 
    Whenever I look at the stars, I am reminded of how short my existence is on this Earth, and that in itself is pretty inspiring to enjoy every moment.
</p>
<br>
<p> Some of the places I have hiked and camped include the Blue Mountains, and through Kosciuszko national park which are both in New South Wales.
I would definitely like to explore more trails through Australia and eventually head overseas to experience more internationally. </p>
<p> I find hiking and camping enjoyable as a hobby as it allows me to build on my hard skills such as:
    <ul>
        <li> Navigating with a map </li>
        <li> Organising an inventory of food and equipment required </li>
        <li> Planning a route taking into account the terrain and weather </li>
        <li> Adapting to changes in weather conditions/situations </li>
        <li> Knowing how to respond in a situation that requires first aid treatment</li> 
    </ul>
    </p>
<br>
<p>Furthermore, hiking and camping allows you to strengthen the relationships of the people you are with.
   Hiking can be challenging, as it is a strenuos physical activity. Often you must work as a team to get to your next destination.
   There are many opportunities to get to know your fellow hiking partners as there are no smart phones to distract you. 
   Many meals are shared over JetBoils and ponderings of the universe.
